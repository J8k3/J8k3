# Jacob Marks
**Senior Software Engineering Leader | Platform Architecture | Regulated Systems**

I am an engineer and builder with over a decade of experience at **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** and in the defense sector, specializing in the design and operation of security-critical, regulated infrastructure at massive scale[cite: 6, 11, 32].

## 🚀 Engineering Leadership & Design
While I lead multi-team organizations, I remain a technical driver focused on system design, platform architecture, and ownership models that scale[cite: 7, 9].

### **AWS Payment Cryptography (2020–2026)**
I led the engineering efforts to build a cloud-native cryptography-as-a-service platform from the ground up:
* **Core Architecture:** Led the definition and launch of a globally deployed, hardware-backed payment cryptographic service[cite: 14].
* **Security & Compliance:** Authored foundational threat models and designed reusable secure rack-level infrastructure that established the PCI-compliant baseline for multiple HSM-backed services[cite: 15, 18].
* **Systems Design:** Defined and governed control-plane and data-plane designs to ensure system coherence and operational security posture[cite: 19].
* **Optimization:** Spearheaded fleet-health monitoring that improved HSM capacity efficiency from 90% to 95%[cite: 20].

### **EC2 Core Platform (2018–2020)**
* **Petabyte-Scale Systems:** Directed mission-critical networking and telemetry services processing **hundreds of petabytes of data**[cite: 23, 25].
* **Blast Radius Reduction:** Led the architectural separation of tightly coupled telemetry and billing systems to enable independent service evolution[cite: 24].

## 🛠️ Technical Expertise
* **Primary Language:** C# / .NET Core
* **Supporting Tech:** Go, Python, Shell scripting
* **Regulated Infrastructure:** PCI-DSS Compliance, HSM-backed systems, NIST/DoD Cloud Accreditation (ATO)[cite: 15, 20, 36].
* **Specialized Design:** Threat Modeling, Payment Cryptography, Secure Key Management, and EC2 Networking[cite: 14, 18, 21, 23].

## 🔄 GitHub Account Transition
