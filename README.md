# Jacob Marks

**Senior Software Engineering Leader | Platform Architecture | Regulated Systems**

I am a technical leader and builder with over a decade of experience at **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** and in the defense sector. I specialize in the design and operation of security-critical, regulated infrastructure at massive scale.

## 🚀 Engineering Leadership & Architecture

While I lead multi-team organizations, I remain a technical driver focused on system design, platform architecture, and ownership models that scale.

### **AWS Payment Cryptography (2020–2026)**

I led the engineering efforts to build a cloud-native cryptography-as-a-service platform from the ground up:

* **Core Architecture:** Led the definition and launch of a first-of-its-kind, globally deployed, hardware-backed payment cryptographic service.
* **Security & Compliance:** Authored foundational threat models and designed reusable secure rack-level infrastructure that established the PCI-compliant baseline for multiple HSM-backed services.
* **Systems Design:** Defined and governed control-plane and data-plane designs to ensure system coherence and operational security posture.
* **Operational Optimization:** Spearheaded fleet-health monitoring that improved HSM capacity efficiency from 90% to 95%.

### **EC2 Core Platform (2018–2020)**

* **High-Scale Systems:** Directed mission-critical networking and telemetry services processing **hundreds of petabytes of data**.
* **Blast Radius Reduction:** Led the architectural separation of tightly coupled telemetry and billing systems to enable independent service evolution.

## 🛠️ Technical Expertise

* **Primary Language:** C# / .NET Core
* **Regulated Infrastructure:** PCI-DSS Compliance, HSM-backed systems, and NIST/DoD Cloud Accreditation (ATO).
* **Specialized Design:** Threat Modeling, Payment Cryptography, Secure Key Management, and EC2 Networking.
